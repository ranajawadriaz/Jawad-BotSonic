Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. 

Key concepts in machine learning include:

1. Supervised Learning: Training models on labeled data to predict outcomes for new data.
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in data without labeled examples.
3. Deep Learning: Using neural networks with multiple layers to solve complex problems.
4. Natural Language Processing: Teaching computers to understand and generate human language.

Vector embeddings are a crucial component of modern AI systems. They convert text, images, or other data into numerical representations that capture semantic meaning. This allows machines to understand relationships between concepts.

ChromaDB is a vector database that excels at storing and searching these embeddings efficiently. It enables semantic search capabilities where you can find similar content based on meaning rather than just keyword matching.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems combine the power of vector search with large language models to provide accurate, context-aware responses based on your specific data.
